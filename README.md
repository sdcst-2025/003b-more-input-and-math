##### Task 3 Heron's Formula:
write a program to calculate the area of a triangle provided the 3 sides are known:
sample:
```
I will use Heron's formula to find the area of a triangle provided that all 3 sides are known.
You will need to enter the lengths of the 3 sides: a, b and c
Enter the length of side a: 3
Enter the length of side b: 5
Enter the length of side c: 7
Your half perimeter is 7.5
The area of your triangle is 6.495
